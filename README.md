- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ari-Arbitrary
- 👀 I’m interested in technology and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning fullstack web development but have long term goals to learn more about software development and make plugins for musical effects.
- 💞️ Not currently looking to work on projects collaboratively, but would be happy to talk to others who are learning web development as well.
- 📫 How to reach me - look for "ariarbitrary" on discord.
